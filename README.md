# Medoas Intelligence Bot

**Medoas Intelligence** is an automated, AI-driven market intelligence pipeline designed to synthesize raw news feeds into distinct, actionable executive briefings. It employs a "Low-Res Overhead" design philosophy and a "Commander" tone for decisive, military-grade market analysis.

## Core Directives

1.  **Objectivity**: Strips away the "Propaganda Layer" from news using a cynical AI persona.
2.  **Synthesis**: Condenses vast information streams into:
    *   **2-Hour Pulse**: Rapid updates on breaking developments.
    *   **24-Hour Wrap**: A comprehensive "Commander's Brief" for executive review.
3.  **Actionability**: Translates data into explicit portfolio guidance (e.g., "Overweight Na-Ion", "Accumulate BTC").
4.  **Accessibility**: Deploys a mobile-optimized, bilingual (English/Arabic) dashboard to GitHub Pages.

## Project Architecture

*   **`pipeline.py`**: The central nervous system. Manages the 2-hour pulse, the daily wrap, and the publishing workflow. Optimized for low-resource environments (1GB RAM VPS).
*   **`logic_engine.py`**: The "brain". Uses advanced LLMs (via OpenRouter) to analyze text, generate the "Commander" executive brief, and perform English-to-Arabic translations.
*   **`feeder.py`**: Ingests RSS feeds and other data sources, ensuring a steady stream of raw intelligence.
*   **`publish.py`**: Generates the high-fidelity HTML dashboard with premium styling, responsive tables, and RTL support for Arabic users.
*   **`database.py`**: Manages the SQLite storage for deduplication, context retention, and history tracking.

## Deployment & Setup

This project is designed to run on a lightweight VPS or via GitHub Actions.

### Environment Variables (GitHub Secrets)
